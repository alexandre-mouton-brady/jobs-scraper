# Jobs Scraper

## Goal

[EXPERIMENTAL] This is a script that will scrap jobs on a list of tech companies and save them in JSON files. The idea is to either store them in a DB afterwards or serve them directly. A front-end app will be able to consume them.

## Built With

-   [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) - Headless browser by Google Chrome
-   [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The backend technology that powers the script
-   [ESM](https://github.com/standard-things/esm) - Enable ES6 import / export syntax in a Node environement
